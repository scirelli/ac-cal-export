=============

AircraftClubs.com calendar export to Google Calendar.

I don't like the calendar interface taht Aircraft Clubs uses on their site. They don't even allow export of the data to other calendars. So I'm creating a Chrome extension to do that.

This extexion will add a "Export to Calendar" button which will create a calendar for each resource and add each reasources events to that calendar. 

Requires:
--------

    Placed into /js/lib/calendar
